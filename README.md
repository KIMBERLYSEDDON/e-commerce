# e-commerce

## Description

This application was built to help managers at internet retail companies keep track of products in stock and associated categories. Being able to keep inventory organized helps the company be more competitive with larger businesses. This application is only the backend of a larger system.

## Installation

To use this application the user must open the terminal and start mysql. Afterwards Insomnia is used to view and edit data.

## Usage 

To view data user must use a GET request at localhost:3001/api and either add /categories, /products, or /tags. User can edit certain categories, products, or tags by using a PUT request at any of the three api endpoints. To add new information the user can use a POST request, and finally to delete a DELETE request should be used.
